# Amazon Web Scraping Project

This project showcases a web scraping application built in Python to extract product data from Amazon. By utilizing the power of web scraping, it allows users to gather valuable information from Amazon's website and analyze it for various purposes.

## Features

- **Product Data Extraction**: The script scrapes product details such as name, price, rating, and reviews from Amazon's product pages.
- **Customizable Search**: Users can specify the search term and the number of products they want to scrape, allowing for tailored data extraction.
- **Data Export**: The scraped data can be exported to a CSV file for further analysis and manipulation in other tools or applications.
- **Headless Browser**: The application uses a headless browser, powered by Selenium, to navigate through the Amazon website and retrieve the desired data.
- **Robust and Efficient**: The script is designed to handle potential errors and exceptions gracefully, ensuring a smooth scraping process even with a large number of products.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- ChromeDriver (for running the script with Google Chrome)

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Download and install ChromeDriver from the official website (https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads).
3. Configure the `config.py` file to specify your preferred search term, the number of products to scrape, and the file path for exporting the data.
4. Run the `main.py` script to initiate the web scraping process.
5. Wait for the script to complete, and the scraped data will be saved in the specified CSV file.

## Limitations

- This project should be used for educational and personal purposes only. Be mindful of the legal implications and respect Amazon's terms of service.
- The scraping process heavily relies on the website's structure, so any changes to Amazon's HTML markup may cause the script to break. Regular maintenance and updates might be necessary to ensure the continued functionality of the scraper.
- Amazon's website is subjected to anti-scraping measures, such as CAPTCHAs and IP blocking. It's recommended to use appropriate proxies or delay settings to avoid detection.

## Disclaimer

This project is intended for educational purposes only. The developer does not endorse or encourage any misuse of the application, including but not limited to violating the terms of service of Amazon or any other website being scraped. Users of this project should be aware of the legal and ethical considerations of web scraping and use the tool responsibly.
